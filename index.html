                    <h3>Stone Mountain, North Carolina</h3>
                    <p>Stone Mountain State Park is located in the North-Western portion of North Carolina. I completed this trail a few years ago, I am not sure as to all the trails in the park as I had limited time here, the trail I completed started by descending down the side of a waterfall and staying on the trail until I came upon a historical village. Once I hit the village the trail is hard to find, at least it was for me. To journey up to the peak of Stone Mountain, you need to stay left after the village to find the trail, I saw a group of men stray down the road directly ahead of the village because they failed to find the trail, I never saw them again... Do not take the road, find the trail. Next I traveled up a steep flight of stairs that led up the mountain, it was strenuous and I needed to take 2-3 short breaks to complete this section of the trail. Eventually I came to an exposed portion of the trail where I held onto a rope while climbing the face of the mountain. This was my favorite part of the trail, the experience is exhilarating and the rush of adrenaline is sure to leave a lasting impression, it sure did for me. After this section you are at the summit and continue on the trail for a short period until you reach the parking lot. I will make a more detailed page about Stone Mountain but this is the general overview of the hike.   </p>

                    <h3>Indian Staircase: Red River Gorge, KY</h3>
                     <p>Honestly, it is impossible for me to choose between Stone Mountain and the Indian Staircase. I will say, in terms of excitment and unrivaled sensations, the Indian Staircase takes the prize. I have never hiked a more thrilling and frightening hike in my life, there is nothing quite like climbing up the face of an exposed rock face where you have to scramble the entire way up. It was one of those rare moments where I knew if I made a mistake, it would probably be my last. The rest of the trail is not as thrilling as the staircase, but for a good portion of the trail you are walking on the edge of the mountain which is quite exciting. If you want adventure, beauty, and danger, the Indian Staircase is for you. </p><br>

                    <h3>Carolina Beach State Park, North Carolina</h3>
                    <p>As someone born and raised in Pennsylvania who frequented the beaches of New Jersey and Delaware, I was not prepared for the charm this park had to offer. Carolina Beach is like nothing I have ever experienced, and it is one of the only places where Venus Fly Traps grow natively. Not only was the park incredible, but it was also within a short drive to Wilmington, NC and countless other interesting locations such as the Fort Fisher State Recreation Area. While you are there, be sure to check out the North Carolina Aquariums within the Fort Fisher area, truly one of the best aquariums I have ever visited.   </p><br>

                    <h3>Worlds End State Park, Pennsylvania</h3>
                    <p>So far, this is my favorite park within PA. The park offers a wide variety of trails ranging from easy to hard and each trail has its own unique charm. My experience with this park is slightly biased, I stayed in a cabin here over winter a few years ago, the Loyalsock Creek ran right next to the cabin and you could hear the water flowing throughout the night. It was perfect, this park was like a dream and I cannot recommend it enough if you are in PA, and at this point I have been all over PA and I can still say this is my favorite park in the state with certainty.</p><br>

                    <h3>Seneca Rocks/Spruce Knob, West Virginia</h3>
                    <p>Honestly, it has been a struggle choosing this last one, mostly because there are so many places I have visited that I could just as easily choose, which is why I have narrowed it down to two parks very near to eachother. I camped near Seneca Rocks and I believe it was only a 45 minute drive to Spruce Knob, I highly recommend doing both if you are in the area. Seneca Rocks is a short but tough hike, the overlook is incredible as well as the rugged terrain that is climbable, but be careful, poeple have died climbing on those rocks so proceed with caution. If you are not an experienced climber and do not possess proper safety equiptment, I do not condone climbing on the rocks.<br> Spruce Knob is the highest point in West Virginia and the overlooks are simply stunning. I took the huckleberry trail which had a very unique ecology due to its extremely high elevation, the trail is long and grueling so be warned. The huckleberry trail as well as the overlook trail took around 4 hours and was around 10 miles. If you plan to do this, bring plenty of food and water and be prepared to take breaks.

                    <h3>Rock Climbing: The Kildoo Boulder</h3>
                    <p>Overall this is a very fun and easy climb. However, before bouldering be sure to have the proper safety equiptment such as pads. As far as I know, this boulder has not been used in the past so it has no name or grade, it is most likely a V0-V1.
                      <br>  To reach the boulder begin to take the trail up to Kildoo Falls, before the trail steeply ascends you will see a few trails that branch off to the right. Take the highest trail for about 10-15 minutes and you will find the boulder.</p>

                    <h3>GrindStone Falls</h3>
                    <p>Out of all the trails in McConnells Mill, Grindstone Falls is the most difficult to traverse. The trail is covered in mud and has a few steep declines you have to go down to get to the falls. Fortunately, the trail is easy to follow and short. <br>The falls itself are small but flow well, especially after rain. However, the better the falls flow, the more muddy the trail will be due to the rain. Making your way back up from the falls is the most difficult part of the hike. The walk back is mostly uphill and very steep, paired with mud it is somewhat difficult to walk back up. I highly recommend wearing boots and pants for this trail. Also, the trail has a lot of long grass you will likely be touching so be wary of tics.<br> In conclusion, the trail is decent but the falls are by far the best part of the hike.

                <p>Welcome to my blog! I spend my time chasing sunsets and collecting stories, I’m always on the move, fueled by curiosity and the thrill of the unknown. Life’s an endless adventure — whether I'm wandering through hidden trails, diving into new books, or embracing every opportunity to grow. For me, exploring isn’t just about places; it’s about learning, finding balance, and nourishing both body and soul.

                    I’m passionate about health, movement, and the joy of living free. Each day brings a chance to uncover something new, be it a hidden gem in nature or a fresh way to nourish myself. Wherever the wind takes me next, I’m ready to dive in headfirst, heart wide open, and always seeking that next spark of wonder.</p>
